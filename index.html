  - <>Do not get carried away by operators offering 0% fees and with high saturation of funds. 
  - Also operators with low fees may not be able to offer 99.99% uptime thus missing out on ADA rewards
  - Low fee and high saturation of funds is not always good for the IOHK reward algorithm. See article below
  IOHK algorithm will not always favor saturated pools Check this article to make an informed decision of your choice and also help operators with low stake to promote true decentralization of the Cardano eco system.
